# Tree Generation
Procedural tree generation in Unity using concepts from research paper: Plant Models Faithful to Botanical Structure and </br> Development by Philippe de Reffye et al. Takes as input a seed for a RNG to simulate branch growth according to weights </br>
for the tree's characteristics: plagiotropic, orthotropic, internode radius, internode length, internodes per growth, </br>
phyllotaxy type, growth_cycles, pause probability, death probability, and ramification probability. </br>
