Effort Components:

- choosing where to spawn plants based off of cellular automata so that they grow together to create
patches of flowers and trees
- lakes formed by changing color of mesh to noisy blue value if height at mesh there is low (also sand color around lake)
- terrain chunks and their plants will be removed if the camera goes far enough
